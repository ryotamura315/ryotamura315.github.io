      <h1> Welcome!</h1>
        I am a Ph.D. candidate in Kamiyama Lab at the University of Georgia. 
        My enthusiasm lies in engineering new proteins and utilizing them to address molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases. 
        I am interested in a variety of scientific disciplines, including protein engineering, neuroscience, glycobiology, 
        cancer biology, cellular biology, genetics, bioinformatics, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>When I am not in lab, I am self-teaching computational skills, learning new languages 
        (recently Spanish and Cantonese), playing pick-up soccer, trying new latin recipes, 
        or socializing in downtown Athens. Being originally from Tokyo, Japan, I have an in-depth knowledge about 
        where to eat good ramen in Shibuya and where to show around my international friends when they come over!

    <p> <b>1/22/2023</b>
      <br> One of my glycobiology projects back in University of Tokyo is now online in Biochemical Journal!
      We engineered a glycosaminoglycan-binding protein into a cancer probe!

    <p> <b>2/23/2022</b>
      <br> I received an Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award (Top 10% TA)!
    </p>
    <p> <b>4/23/2021</b>
      <br> A Split FP paper I am involved in is now online in PNAS!
      Our expanded split FP toolkit has now been applied to visualize two endogenous neuronal proteins in <i>Drosophila</i> brain. Super exciting!
