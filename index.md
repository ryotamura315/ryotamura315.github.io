I am a Ph.D. candidate in Kamiyama Lab at the University of Georgia. My enthusiasm lies in engineering new proteins and utilizing them to address molecular mechanisms underlying human diseases. I am interested in a variety of scientific disciplines, including protein engineering, neuroscience, glycobiology, cancer biology, cellular biology, genetics, bioinformatics, and so on.

When I am not in lab, I am self-teaching computational skills, learning new languages (recently Spanish and Cantonese), playing pick-up soccer, trying new latin recipes, or socializing in downtown Athens. 

Being originally from Tokyo, Japan, I have an in-depth knowledge about where to eat good ramen in Shibuya and where to show around my international friends when they come over!
